Buying Real Silk Fabric by Caroline Campbell (11 February 2021)
Do you have the real silk?
We have everything
from organic cotton
to pure mulberry silk.
Look at the yarn
at the cut edge of the fabric.
Is the fiber soft?
Real silk is premium and luxurious
and its sheer elegance and purity
is delicately extracted 
in a time-consuming process
and spun into soft silk yarn.
Customers have big doubts
about its purity
when they want to buy natural silk.
If you scrunch it up in your hand
you should hear a chunching noise.
That should tell you
it is high quality genuine silk.
